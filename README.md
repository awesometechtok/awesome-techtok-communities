## Contributing

- For the sake of fairness, add community info in alphabetical order based on the first letter or character of the community name.
- Please don't add someone else's community. Only add a community that you are actively involved in.
- The community description should be a short overivew of why the community exists. Tech/coding help? Career networking? Just making friends/hanging out?
- If your description isn't helpful or clear enough, that will be addressed in the PR review. Use good spelling and grammar.
- The maintainer(s) of this repo reserve the right to reject any community for any reason. Toxic, NSFW, spammy, etc communities won't be added. Sorry.
- Instead, let's build communities that are awesome for everyone!
